# O.C.E.A.N. â€“ Open-Hardware Concentration Estimation and Numeration

### What is O.C.E.A.N.?

O.C.E.A.N. stands for Open-Hardware Concentration Estimation and Numeration.

O.C.E.A.N. is a low-cost, open-hardware device for measuring the concentration of liquid samples for cryogenic processing

### Why is concentration measurement important?

Concentration measurements ensure quality management at several crucial steps in the cryopreservation process.

### What is Open-Hardware?

Open-hardware is an emerging movement in scientific research that aims to create freely available, iterative, and community-based designs for manufacturing labware, thereby lowering cost barriers to research.

### Why is the cryopreservation of fish and aquatic species' germplasm important?

1. Food security

2. Biomedical research

3. Genetic Biodiversity
